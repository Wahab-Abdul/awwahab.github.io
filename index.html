    <h2>Effects of Hemoglobin S and C Variants on HbA1c Accuracy in Diabetes Monitoring: A Study in Kumasi and Sunyani, Ghana
</h2>
    <p>
Author: Abdul Walid Wahab </p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Background:</p> 
  <p>HbA1c testing is widely used to assess glycemic control in diabetes. 
However, hemoglobin variants such as HbS and HbC, which are highly prevalent in West Africa, may interfere with HbA1c 
measurements, leading to misinterpretation of glycemic status.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p> A cross-sectional study was conducted at two sites in Ghana: Kumasi (Ashanti Region) and Sunyani (Bono Region). 
A total of 225 participants were enrolled: 150 with normal hemoglobin genotype (HbAA), 50 with sickle cell disease (HbSS), 
and 25 with compound heterozygous HbSC. For each participant, HbA1c, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and random blood sugar (RBS) 
were measured. Concordance between HbA1c-derived estimated average glucose (eAG) and direct glucose measurements was 
analyzed.</p>
<p>Results:</p> 
<p>HbAA participants showed strong correlation between HbA1c and FBS (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). In contrast, 
HbSS participants demonstrated significant negative bias, with mean HbA1c values approximately 0.7% lower than predicted 
from corresponding glucose values (p < 0.01). HbSC participants exhibited variable results, with 28% showing underestimation 
of glycemia by HbA1c and 16% showing overestimation. Bland–Altman analysis revealed narrower limits of agreement in HbAA 
compared with HbSS and HbSC groups. Misclassification occurred in 22% of HbSS and 18% of HbSC participants when using 
HbA1c ≥6.5% as the diagnostic threshold for diabetes.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p> 
<p>Hemoglobin variants HbS and HbSC significantly affect the reliability of HbA1c in assessing glycemic control. 
In regions with high prevalence of these variants, HbA1c should be interpreted cautiously, and glucose-based tests may be 
more appropriate for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring.</p>

    <h>Assesment of PT and aPTT Values To Monitor Venom-Induced Consumptive Coagulopathy Among Snakebite Victims in the Bono,
       Bono East, and Ahafo Regions of Ghana</h2>
    <p>Abstract</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Snakebite envenomation remains a major public health burden in rural Ghana,
with Echis ocellatus (saw-scaled viper) responsible for most bites. 
A common clinical manifestation is venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC), 
which arises from the procoagulant activity of venom toxins leading to factor depletion, hemorrhage, 
and prolonged clotting times.</p> 
<p>Methods:</p> 
<p>A longitudinal comparative study was conducted in selected hospitals in the Bono, Bono East, 
and Ahafo regions of Ghana. Blood samples were collected from snakebite victims (n=7) and controls (n=12). 
Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) were measured at admission and repeated one month 
post-treatment with antivenom. Data were analyzed using SPSS v22.0, with p<0.05 considered significant.</p>
<p>Results: </p>
<p>At admission, all snakebite victims had prolonged PT and aPTT compared to controls 
  (p=0.017 for PT; p<0.001 for aPTT). After one month, most patients (71.4%) had normal PT values, but a majority (71.4%) 
  continued to exhibit prolonged aPTT. Paired t-test showed significant improvement in aPTT (p=0.0002), 
  but no substantial change in PT values over time (p>0.05).</p>
<p>Conclusion: </p>
<p>Snakebite victims in Ghana present with marked coagulation abnormalities consistent with VICC. 
Despite antivenom treatment, aPTT remained abnormal in most patients after one month, 
suggesting persistent defects in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. 
Continuous monitoring and follow-up testing are necessary to prevent complications and guide clinical management.</p>

    <h2>Therapeutic Effects of Cinnamaldehyde in Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
    <p>Abstract</p>

<p>Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing global health problem characterized by hyperglycemia 
due to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. There is growing interest in plant-derived compounds as adjunct therapies.
Cinnamaldehyde, the major active constituent of cinnamon, has demonstrated anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and 
lipid-modulating properties.</p>

<p>Methods: A controlled experimental study was designed involving 90 participants recruited from outpatient clinics. 
Participants were divided into three groups: Group A (non-diabetic controls, n=30), 
Group B (T2DM patients on metformin alone, n=30), and Group C (T2DM patients on metformin plus cinnamaldehyde 120 mg/day, 
n=30). Baseline and 12-week follow-up measurements included fasting blood sugar (FBS), random blood sugar (RBS), 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides). 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v22.0, with p<0.05 considered significant.</p>

<p>Results: At baseline, Groups B and C showed significantly higher FBS, RBS, HbA1c, and LDL compared to controls (p<0.001). 
After 12 weeks, Group C (cinnamaldehyde + metformin) showed marked improvements: 
HbA1c decreased by 1.3% compared to a 0.7% reduction in Group B, FBS was reduced by 25%, and HOMA-IR values indicated 
improved insulin sensitivity. Lipid profiles improved significantly in Group C, 
with LDL decreasing by 18% and HDL increasing by 12%. No adverse effects were reported among the treatment group.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Cinnamaldehyde demonstrated therapeutic potential in improving glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and 
lipid profile in patients with T2DM when used as an adjunct to standard therapy. 
These findings suggest that cinnamaldehyde may be an effective and safe complementary treatment option for diabetes 
management.</p>

        <h2>Bioinformatics Approach to Computational DNA Sequence Analyzer: Validation, Stability and GC/AT 
          Content Profiling (DNA Sequence Calculator)</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>The ability to analyze DNA sequences efficiently is fundamental in molecular biology, genomics, and biotechnology. 
Parameters such as GC/AT content, melting temperature (Tm), and codon usage provide critical insights for applications 
ranging from PCR primer design to gene expression studies. However, many existing tools are either fragmented across 
multiple platforms or require advanced coding skills. To address this gap, I developed a DNA Sequence Calculator, a 
lightweight Python-based tool for rapid sequence analysis.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>⦁	The primary objectives of the project were:
⦁	To design a computational tool that accepts raw DNA sequences in FASTA format or as direct input.
⦁	To implement core functionalities for GC/AT content calculation, melting temperature estimation, sequence length 
determination, and codon frequency analysis.
⦁	To validate the tool against publicly available gene sequences and assess its reliability.</p>

<p>Methodology</p>
<p>The tool was implemented in Python, leveraging its efficiency in string manipulation and scientific computing. 
Input sequences were validated to ensure correct nucleotide representation (A, T, G, C). Algorithms included:
⦁	GC/AT Content: Percentage calculation of guanine–cytosine (G+C) and adenine–thymine (A+T) nucleotides.
⦁	Melting Temperature (Tm): Basic estimation using the Wallace rule (Tm = 2 × (A+T) + 4 × (G+C)).
⦁	Codon Usage: Frequency table generated by parsing triplets across the sequence.
⦁	Sequence Length: Total nucleotide count.
⦁	Outputs were returned in a structured format, making the tool accessible for both students and early-career researchers.</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>The DNA Sequence Calculator was tested on HBB gene sequences retrieved from NCBI. The tool consistently computed GC/AT 
content (~54% GC), provided Tm values that were comparable to established platforms, and 
generated codon usage tables that highlighted genetic code redundancy and codon bias. These outcomes confirmed both the 
stability and validity of the implementation.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>This project demonstrates the feasibility of developing custom computational tools for fundamental sequence analysis. 
The DNA Sequence Calculator offers an efficient approach for profiling DNA stability via GC/AT ratios and supports basic 
molecular design applications. Its modular structure allows for future expansion, including modules for restriction mapping, 
reverse complement generation, or BLAST integration. Importantly, the tool also has educational potential for 
genomics training in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The DNA Sequence Calculator provides a validated and extensible framework for computational sequence analysis, 
delivering essential insights into DNA stability, GC/AT content profiling, and codon usage. By bridging computation with 
molecular biology, it serves as a foundation for broader applications in genomics, biotechnology, and precision medicine.</p>

        <h2>Evolutionary Bioinformatics Analysis of the Hemoglobin β-Subunit (HBB): Sequence Conservation, 
          Mutation Insight, and Phylogenetic Relationships
</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>The hemoglobin β-subunit (HBB) is an essential component of the tetrameric hemoglobin protein, 
  which facilitates oxygen transport in red blood cells. Encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11p15.5, 
  this protein interacts with the α-subunit to form the α2β2 hemoglobin molecule. Mutations in HBB are 
  clinically significant, with the most prominent being the E6V (Glu→Val at codon 6) mutation, which leads to 
  hemoglobin S (HbS) and sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia affects millions worldwide and remains one of 
  the most common inherited blood disorders in sub-Saharan Africa.
From an evolutionary perspective, HBB serves as a model for studying molecular conservation and divergence. 
Because oxygen transport is a critical function across vertebrates, HBB exhibits high conservation among mammals, 
but subtle variations also reflect species-specific adaptations. Using comparative bioinformatics, 
we can characterize HBB’s conservation patterns, identify critical residues, and infer evolutionary relationships. T
his project combines BLAST sequence similarity searches, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), 
and phylogenetic reconstruction to analyze HBB homologs in humans and representative mammals.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>⦁	To retrieve and curate HBB protein sequences from humans and selected mammals 
  (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Mus musculus, Bos taurus).
⦁	To assess sequence similarity using BLASTp and quantify identity/coverage.
⦁	To perform multiple sequence alignment and identify conserved versus variable regions.
⦁	To construct a phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support to infer evolutionary relationships.
⦁	To evaluate the clinical significance of conserved residues, with special focus on the E6V sickle cell mutation.</p>

<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Sequence Retrieval</p>
<p>The human HBB protein sequence (NP_000509.1) was retrieved from the NCBI database. 
  Homologous sequences were selected from Pan troglodytes (XP_018891709.1), Gorilla gorilla (XM_019036164.3), 
  Mus musculus (NP_008211.1), and Bos taurus (NP_001193237.1). Sequences were downloaded in FASTA format.</p>

<p>BLASTp Analysis</p>
<p>BLASTp was used to query human HBB against the NCBI non-redundant database. Parameters included a BLOSUM62 
  substitution matrix and default gap penalties. Results were filtered by query coverage and E-value to ensure 
  high-quality alignments.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
Sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI). The alignment was evaluated for conserved motifs,
 particularly those corresponding to the heme-binding pocket and inter-subunit contact sites. The residue 
 corresponding to Glu6 (critical in sickle cell anemia) was closely examined for conservation across species.

Phylogenetic Tree Construction
Aligned sequences were imported into MEGA X, and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed. 
Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was performed to assess node confidence. 
Evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction model, appropriate for protein sequence analysis.

Clinical Correlation
Mutation sites in the human HBB sequence were compared with the conserved residues across species. 
The E6V mutation site was mapped to evaluate evolutionary conservation and its structural/functional implications.</p>

<p>Results

BLASTp Analysis (Table 1)
The BLAST results confirmed high conservation of HBB among mammals. Human HBB was ~100% identical to Pan 
troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, reflecting close evolutionary proximity. More distant species, such as Mus 
musculus and Bos taurus, exhibited reduced similarity (~88% and ~86%, respectively), b
ut still retained complete query coverage and significant E-values (0.0).</p>

<p>Table 1. BLASTp sequence similarity results of human HBB against selected mammals</p>

<p>Species	Accession	% Identity	Query Coverage	E-value</p>
<p>Pan troglodytes	XP_018891709.1	~100%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Gorilla gorilla	XM_019036164.3	~100%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Mus musculus	NP_008211.1	~88%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Bos taurus	NP_001193237.1	~86%	100%	0.0</p>

<p>Multiple Sequence Alignment
The Clustal Omega alignment revealed strong conservation across all sequences. Residues forming the heme-binding site (e.g., His92, Phe43) were fully conserved. The region surrounding codon 6 (Glu6) was invariant in all species analyzed, emphasizing its functional importance. This supports the observation that the E6V mutation in humans is pathogenic because it alters a conserved residue essential for structural stability and solubility.

Phylogenetic Analysis (Figure 1)
The Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree grouped human HBB with Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla in a high-confidence 
cluster (bootstrap support >95%). Rodent (Mus musculus) and bovine (Bos taurus) sequences formed separate branches, 
reflecting their more distant evolutionary relationships. The tree topology is consistent with established primate and 
mammalian evolutionary relationships.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree of HBB protein sequences from human, chimpanzee, gorilla, mouse, and cow. 
Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates are shown at branch nodes.</p>

<p>Discussion

⦁	This study highlights the dual biological and clinical significance of HBB conservation. Evolutionary conservation of 
HBB across mammals demonstrates its critical role in oxygen transport, where even minor variations may have significant 
physiological consequences. The high similarity among primates confirms their recent evolutionary divergence, 
while rodents and bovines reflect deeper evolutionary splits.
⦁	The conservation of codon 6 (glutamic acid in humans) across species underscores why the E6V mutation is deleterious: 
substituting a polar, charged amino acid with a hydrophobic residue destabilizes hemoglobin solubility, 
leading to polymerization and sickling of red blood cells. This mutation exemplifies how a single point mutation in a 
conserved region can drive a widespread genetic disease.
⦁	The combination of BLAST, multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenetics proved effective in linking 
evolutionary biology to clinical genetics. This framework can be extended to study other hemoglobinopathies, 
globin family proteins, or mutations underlying genetic disorders.</p>

<p>Conclusion
The bioinformatics analysis of HBB confirms its strong evolutionary conservation across mammals and highlights the 
functional significance of conserved residues, particularly Glu6. The E6V substitution responsible for 
sickle cell disease exemplifies how single, evolutionarily conserved sites are critical for protein stability and function. 
Integrating BLAST similarity searches, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction provides a robust workflow for 
connecting molecular evolution, protein structure, and clinical genetics.

This project demonstrates how computational biology can bridge evolutionary insights with medical relevance, 
providing both academic and translational value.

        <h2>Conceptual Framework for a Low-Cost Coagulation Profile Test Kit for Underserved Health Facilities in Ghana</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hemostasis, the process that prevents excessive bleeding following vascular injury, 
depends on the balanced function of the 
coagulation cascade, platelets, and fibrinolysis. Laboratory tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT), 
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and fibrinogen assays are critical in diagnosing coagulation disorders, 
monitoring anticoagulant therapy, and guiding clinical interventions in conditions such as liver disease, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), and venom-induced consumption coagulopathy.
In Ghana, however, access to coagulation testing is severely limited. While tertiary hospitals are equipped with 
coagulometers and automated analyzers, district and rural health facilities often lack these diagnostic capabilities, 
leaving a significant proportion of the population without timely access to essential clotting tests. This diagnostic 
gap contributes to delayed treatment, increased morbidity, and avoidable mortality.
To address this challenge, this project proposes the conceptual design and future development of a low-cost, locally 
adaptable coagulation profile test kit. The kit is intended to be stable at room temperature, affordable, easy to use by 
mid-level health workers, and adaptable to low-resource environments.</p>

Objectives
<p>⦁	The specific objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>⦁	To design a coagulation profile test kit capable of simultaneously performing PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen testing.</p>
⦁<p>	To identify cost-effective reagent formulations optimized for stability under tropical conditions (25–30°C).</p>
<p>⦁	To simplify assay workflows for point-of-care use, minimizing reliance on advanced equipment.</p>
⦁	<p>To establish a framework for clinical validation and quality assurance against reference laboratory standards.</p>
<p>⦁	To ultimately expand access to life-saving diagnostic tools for underserved health facilities in Ghana.</p>

<p>Proposed Methodology</p>

<p>1. Reagent Development
Prothrombin Time (PT):
Development of a thromboplastin reagent (tissue factor + phospholipids) with stabilizers (e.g., glycerol or sugars) to 
ensure heat stability.</p>

<p>Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):
Preparation of kaolin/cephalin reagent mix as intrinsic pathway activators. The formulation will be optimized for 
reproducibility while reducing batch variability.</p>

<p>Fibrinogen (Clauss method adaptation):
Simplified thrombin-based reagent system for fibrinogen quantification. The assay workflow will be adapted to require 
minimal pipetting steps.</p>

<p>2. Kit Assembly</p>

<p>⦁	Packaging reagents into small, single-use vials to reduce waste and contamination.
⦁	Color-coded labeling and simplified procedural steps for ease of use.
⦁	Instructional material (infographics/manuals) designed for health workers with limited lab training.</p>

<p>3. Prototype Testing and Validation (Future Phase)
⦁	Comparative testing of the kit against standard coagulometers in a tertiary hospital setting.
⦁	Validation parameters: accuracy, reproducibility, precision, and linearity across normal and pathological samples.
⦁	Stability assessment over 3–6 months at room temperature storage (25–30°C).</p>

<p>4. Implementation Plan
⦁	Pilot deployment in selected district hospitals and health centers in Ghana.
⦁	Training of health workers on kit use and data recording.
⦁	Feedback integration to improve usability and robustness.</p>

<p>Expected Results and Deliverables</p>
<p>Although still conceptual, the anticipated outcomes of this project include:
⦁	A prototype coagulation profile kit that reliably measures PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels.
⦁	Demonstrated reagent stability under tropical storage conditions.
⦁	Proof of diagnostic accuracy comparable to reference laboratory analyzers.
⦁	A scalable, low-cost diagnostic solution adaptable for other low-resource countries.</p>

<p>Potential Impact</p>
<p>The successful development of a low-cost coagulation test kit has broad implications:
⦁	Clinical impact: Early and accurate diagnosis of bleeding and clotting disorders, improved monitoring of anticoagulant 
therapy, and timely management of emergencies such as snakebite-induced coagulopathy, which is prevalent in rural Ghana.
⦁	Public health impact: Expanding diagnostic capabilities beyond urban tertiary hospitals to rural and peri-urban facilities.
⦁	Economic impact: Reducing the financial burden of referring patients to centralized hospitals and lowering 
morbidity-related costs.
⦁	Scientific impact: Showcasing Ghana’s capacity to develop home-grown biotechnology solutions tailored for local health 
challenges.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This project outlines a conceptual framework for the development of a low-cost coagulation profile test kit tailored to 
underserved health facilities in Ghana. By integrating simplified assay design, affordable reagents, and tropical stability, 
the kit could bridge a critical gap in hemostasis diagnostics.
While further work is required to move from concept to prototype, the project demonstrates how biomedical innovation can be 
localized to meet pressing healthcare needs. With validation and eventual scaling, this diagnostic tool has the potential 
to significantly improve patient outcomes in low-resource settings and contribute to global health equity.</p>

    <h2>In Silico Repurposing of FDA-Approved and Natural Drugs to Restore p53 Activity via MDM2/MDMX Inhibition</h2>
    <p>Overview</p>

    <p> One of the most important cancer-fighting proteins in the human body is p53, often called the “guardian of the genome.”
       When functioning normally, p53 can stop damaged cells from multiplying and forming tumors. Unfortunately, in many cancers, 
       p53 becomes inactive, not because it is mutated, but because proteins called MDM2 and MDMX bind to it and switch it off.

This project uses computational drug discovery (in silico screening) to search for existing FDA-approved drugs and bioactive 
natural compounds that can block MDM2/MDMX, potentially freeing p53 and reactivating its tumor-suppressor power.</p>
<p>Project Goal</p>

<p> To identify clinically available or naturally derived molecules that can inhibit the MDM2/MDMX p53 interaction using 
  molecular docking simulations. This approach combines the speed of computational screening with the practicality of drug 
  repurposing, offering a faster path toward potential cancer therapies. </p>

  <p>Methodology </p>
  <p>This project follows a systematic in silico workflow: </p>

<p>Protein Target Selection – Retrieved the 3D structure of MDM2 from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) for docking studies.</p>

<p>Ligand Library Preparation – Collected FDA-approved drug structures and selected promising natural compounds with reported 
anticancer activity.</p>

<p>Structure Optimization – Cleaned, minimized, and converted all ligands and proteins into docking-ready formats.</p>

<p>Docking Simulation (Planned) – Will perform virtual screening using tools such as InstaDock and SwissDock to predict which 
molecules best fit into the MDM2/MDMX binding site.</p>

<p>>Analysis (Planned) – Rank hits by binding affinity, visualize binding poses, and prioritize top candidates for potential 
validation. </p>

<p>Current Status</p>

<p>Protein structure prepared</p>
<p>Ligand library curated (FDA-approved + natural molecules)</p>
<p>Docking simulations being set up</p>
<p>Ranking and visualization of top hits to follow </p>

<p> Why This Matters </p>

<p>Drug Repurposing Advantage: FDA-approved drugs already have known safety profiles, making them faster to move toward 
clinical testing.</p>

<p>Global Health Impact: Low-cost cancer therapeutics could have major benefits in resource-limited regions like Ghana and 
West Africa.</p>

<p>Innovation: Combining synthetic and natural drug libraries widens the search for effective, safe inhibitors.</p>
