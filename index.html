    <h2>Effects of Hemoglobin S and C Variants on HbA1c Accuracy in Diabetes Monitoring: A Study in Kumasi and Sunyani, Ghana
</h2>
    <p>
Author: Abdul Walid Wahab </p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Background:</p> 
  <p>HbA1c testing is widely used to assess glycemic control in diabetes. 
However, hemoglobin variants such as HbS and HbC, which are highly prevalent in West Africa, may interfere with HbA1c 
measurements, leading to misinterpretation of glycemic status.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p> A cross-sectional study was conducted at two sites in Ghana: Kumasi (Ashanti Region) and Sunyani (Bono Region). 
A total of 225 participants were enrolled: 150 with normal hemoglobin genotype (HbAA), 50 with sickle cell disease (HbSS), 
and 25 with compound heterozygous HbSC. For each participant, HbA1c, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and random blood sugar (RBS) 
were measured. Concordance between HbA1c-derived estimated average glucose (eAG) and direct glucose measurements was 
analyzed.</p>
<p>Results:</p> 
<p>HbAA participants showed strong correlation between HbA1c and FBS (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). In contrast, 
HbSS participants demonstrated significant negative bias, with mean HbA1c values approximately 0.7% lower than predicted 
from corresponding glucose values (p < 0.01). HbSC participants exhibited variable results, with 28% showing underestimation 
of glycemia by HbA1c and 16% showing overestimation. Bland‚ÄìAltman analysis revealed narrower limits of agreement in HbAA 
compared with HbSS and HbSC groups. Misclassification occurred in 22% of HbSS and 18% of HbSC participants when using 
HbA1c ‚â•6.5% as the diagnostic threshold for diabetes.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p> 
<p>Hemoglobin variants HbS and HbSC significantly affect the reliability of HbA1c in assessing glycemic control. 
In regions with high prevalence of these variants, HbA1c should be interpreted cautiously, and glucose-based tests may be 
more appropriate for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the cornerstone of diabetes monitoring and diagnosis, providing a retrospective index of 
  glycemia over the preceding 8‚Äì12 weeks. 
Its accuracy, however, depends on the stability and lifespan of red blood cells. Hemoglobinopathies such as HbS and HbC, 
which are particularly common in West Africa, may shorten red cell survival or alter hemoglobin glycation, 
leading to inaccurate HbA1c results.

Previous studies in African and African American populations have documented systematic biases in HbA1c interpretation
among individuals with hemoglobin variants.
Yet, little work has been done in Ghana to assess these effects using readily available laboratory methods such as 
Hb electrophoresis, fasting blood sugar, and random blood sugar. 
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HbS and HbSC genotypes on HbA1c‚Äìglucose concordance among adults 
in Kumasi and Sunyani.</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Study design and population</p>

<p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at two tertiary facilities: Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital 
  (Kumasi, Ashanti Region) and Sunyani Regional Hospital (Bono Region).</p>

<p>A total of 225 participants aged 18‚Äì65 years were enrolled and stratified by genotype:</p>

<p>HbAA (control group): 150 participants</p>

<p>HbSS: 50 participants</p>

<p>HbSC: 25 participants</p>

<p>Genotypes were confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis, repeated for quality assurance. 
Individuals with recent transfusions, anemia from other causes, or pregnancy were excluded.</p>

<p>Laboratory analysis</p>

<p>HbA1c was measured using immunoassay.

FBS and RBS were measured using enzymatic glucose oxidase method.

HbA1c-derived estimated average glucose (eAG) was calculated using the ADAG formula:

eAG (mg/dL)=28.7√óHbA1c‚àí46.7</p>

<p>Statistical analysis</p>

<p>Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between HbA1c and glucose.
 Bland‚ÄìAltman plots assessed agreement. 
 Misclassification rates were calculated using WHO diagnostic thresholds (FBS ‚â•7.0 mmol/L or RBS ‚â•11.1 mmol/L; HbA1c ‚â•6.5%).</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>Baseline characteristics</p>

<p>Participants across groups were age- and sex-matched. Mean age was 36 ¬± 11 years, with 58% female participants.</p>

<p>Correlation analysis</p>

<p>HbAA group: Strong correlation between HbA1c and FBS (r = 0.86, p < 0.001).

HbSS group: Weaker correlation (r = 0.62, p < 0.01). HbA1c underestimated glycemia by an average of 0.7%.

HbSC group: Moderate correlation (r = 0.70, p < 0.01) with inconsistent bias.</p>


<p>Agreement analysis</p>

<p>HbAA: mean bias = +0.1 mmol/L (narrow limits: ‚àí1.2 to +1.4 mmol/L).</p>

<p>HbSS: mean bias = ‚àí0.9 mmol/L (wide limits: ‚àí3.2 to +1.5 mmol/L).</p>

<p>HbSC: mean bias = ‚àí0.3 mmol/L (limits: ‚àí2.4 to +1.8 mmol/L).</p>

<p>Misclassification</p>

<p>HbAA: 4% misclassified by HbA1c.</p>

<p>HbSS: 22% misclassified, predominantly underdiagnosed.

HbSC: 18% misclassified (mixed over- and underestimation).</p>

<p>Discussion</p>

<p>Our findings confirm that HbA1c values in HbSS and HbSC individuals in Ghana do not accurately reflect glycemia compared to HbAA controls. 
The underestimation in HbSS aligns with prior studies attributing it to shortened red cell lifespan and altered hemoglobin glycation. 
The variability in HbSC results is consistent with reports of assay-dependent interference.

This has important implications for diabetes care in Ghana, 
where HbS and HbC are common and access to advanced HbA1c methods (e.g., HPLC, capillary electrophoresis) is limited. 
Sole reliance on HbA1c for diagnosis risks underdiagnosis and undertreatment in variant carriers. 
Complementary glucose-based tests should therefore be integrated into practice.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>HbA1c is less reliable in individuals with HbSS and HbSC genotypes compared to HbAA controls. 
In Ghana, clinicians should interpret HbA1c cautiously in patients with known hemoglobinopathies
 and confirm glycemic control using glucose-based assays when possible.</p>

    <h>Assesment of PT and aPTT Values To Monitor Venom-Induced Consumptive Coagulopathy Among Snakebite Victims in the Bono,
       Bono East, and Ahafo Regions of Ghana</h2>
    <p>Abstract</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Snakebite envenomation remains a major public health burden in rural Ghana,
with Echis ocellatus (saw-scaled viper) responsible for most bites. 
A common clinical manifestation is venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC), 
which arises from the procoagulant activity of venom toxins leading to factor depletion, hemorrhage, 
and prolonged clotting times.</p> 
<p>Methods:</p> 
<p>A longitudinal comparative study was conducted in selected hospitals in the Bono, Bono East, 
and Ahafo regions of Ghana. Blood samples were collected from snakebite victims (n=7) and controls (n=12). 
Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) were measured at admission and repeated one month 
post-treatment with antivenom. Data were analyzed using SPSS v22.0, with p<0.05 considered significant.</p>
<p>Results: </p>
<p>At admission, all snakebite victims had prolonged PT and aPTT compared to controls 
  (p=0.017 for PT; p<0.001 for aPTT). After one month, most patients (71.4%) had normal PT values, but a majority (71.4%) 
  continued to exhibit prolonged aPTT. Paired t-test showed significant improvement in aPTT (p=0.0002), 
  but no substantial change in PT values over time (p>0.05).</p>
<p>Conclusion: </p>
<p>Snakebite victims in Ghana present with marked coagulation abnormalities consistent with VICC. 
Despite antivenom treatment, aPTT remained abnormal in most patients after one month, 
suggesting persistent defects in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. 
Continuous monitoring and follow-up testing are necessary to prevent complications and guide clinical management.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Snakebite envenomation is a neglected tropical disease with global incidence estimates of 5.4 million bites annually, 
of which 1.8‚Äì2.7 million result in envenomation and over 80,000 deaths. 
In Ghana, the saw-scaled viper (Echis ocellatus) is the leading cause of envenomation, 
particularly in rural farming communities.
One of the most serious hematological complications of viper envenomation is venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC). 
Venom toxins activate clotting factors, causing uncontrolled thrombin generation, consumption of fibrinogen, 
and secondary bleeding. Prolonged PT and aPTT are key diagnostic indicators of this condition.
This study aimed to assess the coagulation profiles of snakebite victims in the Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo regions, 
compare them with healthy controls, and evaluate changes after one month of treatment.</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Study Area: The study was conducted across health facilities in the Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo regions of Ghana. 
These predominantly agrarian communities report frequent snakebite cases.
Design: A longitudinal comparative study design was employed.
Participants: Snakebite victims (n=7) aged 18‚Äì40 years were recruited using purposive sampling. 
Healthy controls (n=12) were included for baseline comparison. 
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and anticoagulant therapy.
Ethical Approval: Ethical clearance was obtained from the UENR Committee on Human Research and Ethics 
(Ref: CHRE/CA/127/023)</p>.

<p>Sample Collection:</p>
<p>3 mL of venous blood was collected into sodium citrate tubes.
Platelet-poor plasma was prepared by centrifugation.
PT and aPTT were measured using Fortress Diagnostics reagents according to manufacturer instructions.
Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed in SPSS v22.0 using Chi-square and Student‚Äôs t-test. 
P-values <0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>Coagulation Profile at Admission (Cases vs Controls):
Controls had normal mean PT (13.2 ¬± 1.6 s) and aPTT (31.7 ¬± 4.3 s).
Snakebite victims showed prolonged PT (24.4 ¬± 1.9 s, p=0.017) and markedly prolonged aPTT (64.7 ¬± 9.8 s, p<0.001).
Follow-up After 1 Month:
PT normalized in most patients (71.4%), mean PT = 13.5 ¬± 0.6 s.
aPTT remained prolonged in 71.4% of victims, mean aPTT = 38.7 ¬± 7.9 s (p=0.0002 vs baseline).</p>

<p>Comparison:
PT: no significant change between admission and 1 month (p>0.05).
aPTT: significant improvement after 1 month (p=0.0002).</p>

<p>Discussion
The findings confirm that Echis ocellatus envenomation produces significant disturbances in coagulation, 
consistent with VICC. At admission, all victims exhibited prolonged PT and aPTT, 
reflecting consumption of clotting factors across both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
Improvement in PT values after one month suggests partial recovery of the extrinsic pathway. 
However, persistence of prolonged aPTT in most patients indicates ongoing abnormalities in the intrinsic pathway, 
possibly due to incomplete restoration of factors VIII, IX, or XI.
These results align with previous studies in Sri Lanka and West Africa, 
which also documented persistent coagulation abnormalities despite antivenom therapy. 
The persistence of abnormal aPTT underscores the need for extended monitoring and possibly adjunctive therapies.</p>

<p>Conclusion
Snakebite victims in the Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo regions present with coagulation abnormalities typical of VICC. 
While PT values tend to normalize with treatment, prolonged aPTT remains common after one month. 
This indicates incomplete recovery of the coagulation system and highlights the need for long-term follow-up and 
improved management strategies.</p>

<p>Recommendations
‚¶Å	Routine PT and aPTT testing at admission and during follow-up for all snakebite victims.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	Strengthen laboratory diagnostic capacity in rural Ghana for better management of VICC.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	Conduc larger studies to explore long-term outcomes and optimal treatment strategies.</p>

    <h2>Therapeutic Effects of Cinnamaldehyde in Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
    <p>Abstract</p>

<p>Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing global health problem characterized by hyperglycemia 
due to insulin resistance and Œ≤-cell dysfunction. There is growing interest in plant-derived compounds as adjunct therapies.
Cinnamaldehyde, the major active constituent of cinnamon, has demonstrated anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and 
lipid-modulating properties.</p>

<p>Methods: A controlled experimental study was designed involving 90 participants recruited from outpatient clinics. 
Participants were divided into three groups: Group A (non-diabetic controls, n=30), 
Group B (T2DM patients on metformin alone, n=30), and Group C (T2DM patients on metformin plus cinnamaldehyde 120 mg/day, 
n=30). Baseline and 12-week follow-up measurements included fasting blood sugar (FBS), random blood sugar (RBS), 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides). 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v22.0, with p<0.05 considered significant.</p>

<p>Results: At baseline, Groups B and C showed significantly higher FBS, RBS, HbA1c, and LDL compared to controls (p<0.001). 
After 12 weeks, Group C (cinnamaldehyde + metformin) showed marked improvements: 
HbA1c decreased by 1.3% compared to a 0.7% reduction in Group B, FBS was reduced by 25%, and HOMA-IR values indicated 
improved insulin sensitivity. Lipid profiles improved significantly in Group C, 
with LDL decreasing by 18% and HDL increasing by 12%. No adverse effects were reported among the treatment group.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Cinnamaldehyde demonstrated therapeutic potential in improving glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and 
lipid profile in patients with T2DM when used as an adjunct to standard therapy. 
These findings suggest that cinnamaldehyde may be an effective and safe complementary treatment option for diabetes 
management.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2DM), remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
Characterized by insulin resistance, Œ≤-cell dysfunction, and chronic hyperglycemia, T2DM significantly increases the 
risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.

Conventional therapies such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin have improved outcomes, but challenges remain, 
including poor glycemic control, drug resistance, and side effects. 
In this context, natural compounds with anti-diabetic properties are gaining attention.

Cinnamaldehyde, a bioactive compound derived from cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum), has shown potential hypoglycemic, 
antioxidant, and lipid-modulating effects in both animal and human studies. 
Proposed mechanisms include stimulation of insulin receptor signaling, enhancement of GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, 
inhibition of gluconeogenesis, and reduction of inflammatory mediators.

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of cinnamaldehyde as an adjunct to standard treatment in patients with 
T2DM in order to evaluate its impact on glycemic control and lipid metabolism.</p>

<p>Methods</p>

<p>Study Design and Participants: A randomized controlled experimental study was conducted in 90 participants between the 
ages of 30‚Äì60 years. Participants were divided into three groups:

Group A: Healthy non-diabetic controls (n=30)

Group B: T2DM patients treated with metformin alone (n=30)

Group C: T2DM patients treated with metformin plus cinnamaldehyde 120 mg/day (n=30)

Inclusion criteria: Diagnosed T2DM patients with HbA1c >7.0% on stable metformin therapy.
Exclusion criteria: Type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, severe renal/hepatic impairment, or use of insulin therapy.

Measurements: FBS, RBS, HbA1c, and lipid profile (TC, LDL, HDL, TG) were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. 
Insulin sensitivity was assessed using HOMA-IR.

Ethical Considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, 
and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed using SPSS v22.0. ANOVA and paired t-tests were applied. 
Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>At baseline, both diabetic groups (B and C) had significantly elevated glucose and lipid parameters compared to controls 
(p<0.001).

After 12 weeks:

Glycemic control: Group C showed a greater reduction in HbA1c (‚Üì1.3%) compared to Group B (‚Üì0.7%). 
FBS decreased by 25% in Group C vs 12% in Group B.

Insulin sensitivity: HOMA-IR improved significantly in Group C (‚Üì25%), indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity.

Lipid profile: Group C had a significant reduction in LDL (‚Üì18%) and triglycerides (‚Üì15%), with an increase in HDL (‚Üë12%). 
Group B showed modest improvements (LDL ‚Üì6%, HDL ‚Üë4%).

Safety: No adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, or gastrointestinal upset were observed in the 
cinnamaldehyde group.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>

<p>The results of this study demonstrate that cinnamaldehyde supplementation has beneficial effects on glycemic control and 
lipid metabolism in T2DM patients when combined with metformin therapy. 
The improvement in HbA1c and FBS levels suggests that cinnamaldehyde enhances insulin sensitivity and promotes better
glucose utilization.

The lipid-lowering effects observed are consistent with the proposed mechanism of cinnamaldehyde in modulating 
hepatic lipid synthesis and improving cholesterol homeostasis. 
Increased HDL and decreased LDL further support its potential cardiovascular protective role.

These findings align with previous clinical trials and animal studies reporting the hypoglycemic and 
lipid-modulatory effects of cinnamon-derived compounds. Unlike conventional therapies, cinnamaldehyde showed no 
significant adverse effects, suggesting it is safe as a dietary adjunct.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Cinnamaldehyde supplementation significantly improved glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, 
and lipid profile in patients with T2DM. When used as an adjunct to metformin, it provided superior outcomes compared to 
standard therapy alone. These findings support the use of cinnamaldehyde as a safe and effective complementary treatment 
option in the management of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>

<p>‚¶Å	Cinnamaldehyde should be explored as a dietary supplement for diabetic patients in resource-limited settings.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	Larger multicenter clinical trials are needed to validate its long-term efficacy and safety.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	Future studies should investigate its molecular mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	Integration of plant-derived therapies into diabetes care could reduce costs and improve accessibility 
in low-resource countries.</p>

        <h2>Bioinformatics Approach to Computational DNA Sequence Analyzer: Validation, Stability and GC/AT 
          Content Profiling (DNA Sequence Calculator)</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>The ability to analyze DNA sequences efficiently is fundamental in molecular biology, genomics, and biotechnology. 
Parameters such as GC/AT content, melting temperature (Tm), and codon usage provide critical insights for applications 
ranging from PCR primer design to gene expression studies. However, many existing tools are either fragmented across 
multiple platforms or require advanced coding skills. To address this gap, I developed a DNA Sequence Calculator, a 
lightweight Python-based tool for rapid sequence analysis.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>‚¶Å	The primary objectives of the project were:
‚¶Å	To design a computational tool that accepts raw DNA sequences in FASTA format or as direct input.
‚¶Å	To implement core functionalities for GC/AT content calculation, melting temperature estimation, sequence length 
determination, and codon frequency analysis.
‚¶Å	To validate the tool against publicly available gene sequences and assess its reliability.</p>

<p>Methodology</p>
<p>The tool was implemented in Python, leveraging its efficiency in string manipulation and scientific computing. 
Input sequences were validated to ensure correct nucleotide representation (A, T, G, C). Algorithms included:
‚¶Å	GC/AT Content: Percentage calculation of guanine‚Äìcytosine (G+C) and adenine‚Äìthymine (A+T) nucleotides.
‚¶Å	Melting Temperature (Tm): Basic estimation using the Wallace rule (Tm = 2 √ó (A+T) + 4 √ó (G+C)).
‚¶Å	Codon Usage: Frequency table generated by parsing triplets across the sequence.
‚¶Å	Sequence Length: Total nucleotide count.
‚¶Å	Outputs were returned in a structured format, making the tool accessible for both students and early-career researchers.</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>The DNA Sequence Calculator was tested on HBB gene sequences retrieved from NCBI. The tool consistently computed GC/AT 
content (~54% GC), provided Tm values that were comparable to established platforms, and 
generated codon usage tables that highlighted genetic code redundancy and codon bias. These outcomes confirmed both the 
stability and validity of the implementation.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>This project demonstrates the feasibility of developing custom computational tools for fundamental sequence analysis. 
The DNA Sequence Calculator offers an efficient approach for profiling DNA stability via GC/AT ratios and supports basic 
molecular design applications. Its modular structure allows for future expansion, including modules for restriction mapping, 
reverse complement generation, or BLAST integration. Importantly, the tool also has educational potential for 
genomics training in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The DNA Sequence Calculator provides a validated and extensible framework for computational sequence analysis, 
delivering essential insights into DNA stability, GC/AT content profiling, and codon usage. By bridging computation with 
molecular biology, it serves as a foundation for broader applications in genomics, biotechnology, and precision medicine.</p>

        <h2>Evolutionary Bioinformatics Analysis of the Hemoglobin Œ≤-Subunit (HBB): Sequence Conservation, 
          Mutation Insight, and Phylogenetic Relationships
</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>The hemoglobin Œ≤-subunit (HBB) is an essential component of the tetrameric hemoglobin protein, 
  which facilitates oxygen transport in red blood cells. Encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11p15.5, 
  this protein interacts with the Œ±-subunit to form the Œ±2Œ≤2 hemoglobin molecule. Mutations in HBB are 
  clinically significant, with the most prominent being the E6V (Glu‚ÜíVal at codon 6) mutation, which leads to 
  hemoglobin S (HbS) and sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia affects millions worldwide and remains one of 
  the most common inherited blood disorders in sub-Saharan Africa.
From an evolutionary perspective, HBB serves as a model for studying molecular conservation and divergence. 
Because oxygen transport is a critical function across vertebrates, HBB exhibits high conservation among mammals, 
but subtle variations also reflect species-specific adaptations. Using comparative bioinformatics, 
we can characterize HBB‚Äôs conservation patterns, identify critical residues, and infer evolutionary relationships. T
his project combines BLAST sequence similarity searches, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), 
and phylogenetic reconstruction to analyze HBB homologs in humans and representative mammals.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>‚¶Å	To retrieve and curate HBB protein sequences from humans and selected mammals 
  (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Mus musculus, Bos taurus).
‚¶Å	To assess sequence similarity using BLASTp and quantify identity/coverage.
‚¶Å	To perform multiple sequence alignment and identify conserved versus variable regions.
‚¶Å	To construct a phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support to infer evolutionary relationships.
‚¶Å	To evaluate the clinical significance of conserved residues, with special focus on the E6V sickle cell mutation.</p>

<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Sequence Retrieval</p>
<p>The human HBB protein sequence (NP_000509.1) was retrieved from the NCBI database. 
  Homologous sequences were selected from Pan troglodytes (XP_018891709.1), Gorilla gorilla (XM_019036164.3), 
  Mus musculus (NP_008211.1), and Bos taurus (NP_001193237.1). Sequences were downloaded in FASTA format.</p>

<p>BLASTp Analysis</p>
<p>BLASTp was used to query human HBB against the NCBI non-redundant database. Parameters included a BLOSUM62 
  substitution matrix and default gap penalties. Results were filtered by query coverage and E-value to ensure 
  high-quality alignments.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
Sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI). The alignment was evaluated for conserved motifs,
 particularly those corresponding to the heme-binding pocket and inter-subunit contact sites. The residue 
 corresponding to Glu6 (critical in sickle cell anemia) was closely examined for conservation across species.

Phylogenetic Tree Construction
Aligned sequences were imported into MEGA X, and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed. 
Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was performed to assess node confidence. 
Evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction model, appropriate for protein sequence analysis.

Clinical Correlation
Mutation sites in the human HBB sequence were compared with the conserved residues across species. 
The E6V mutation site was mapped to evaluate evolutionary conservation and its structural/functional implications.</p>

<p>Results

BLASTp Analysis (Table 1)
The BLAST results confirmed high conservation of HBB among mammals. Human HBB was ~100% identical to Pan 
troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, reflecting close evolutionary proximity. More distant species, such as Mus 
musculus and Bos taurus, exhibited reduced similarity (~88% and ~86%, respectively), b
ut still retained complete query coverage and significant E-values (0.0).</p>

<p>Species	Accession	% Identity	Query Coverage	E-value</p>
<p>Pan troglodytes	XP_018891709.1	~100%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Gorilla gorilla	XM_019036164.3	~100%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Mus musculus	NP_008211.1	~88%	100%	0.0</p>
<p>Bos taurus	NP_001193237.1	~86%	100%	0.0</p>

<p>Multiple Sequence Alignment
The Clustal Omega alignment revealed strong conservation across all sequences. Residues forming the heme-binding site (e.g., His92, Phe43) were fully conserved. The region surrounding codon 6 (Glu6) was invariant in all species analyzed, emphasizing its functional importance. This supports the observation that the E6V mutation in humans is pathogenic because it alters a conserved residue essential for structural stability and solubility.

Phylogenetic Analysis (Figure 1)
The Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree grouped human HBB with Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla in a high-confidence 
cluster (bootstrap support >95%). Rodent (Mus musculus) and bovine (Bos taurus) sequences formed separate branches, 
reflecting their more distant evolutionary relationships. The tree topology is consistent with established primate and 
mammalian evolutionary relationships.</p>

<p>Discussion

‚¶Å	This study highlights the dual biological and clinical significance of HBB conservation. Evolutionary conservation of 
HBB across mammals demonstrates its critical role in oxygen transport, where even minor variations may have significant 
physiological consequences. The high similarity among primates confirms their recent evolutionary divergence, 
while rodents and bovines reflect deeper evolutionary splits.
‚¶Å	The conservation of codon 6 (glutamic acid in humans) across species underscores why the E6V mutation is deleterious: 
substituting a polar, charged amino acid with a hydrophobic residue destabilizes hemoglobin solubility, 
leading to polymerization and sickling of red blood cells. This mutation exemplifies how a single point mutation in a 
conserved region can drive a widespread genetic disease.
‚¶Å	The combination of BLAST, multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenetics proved effective in linking 
evolutionary biology to clinical genetics. This framework can be extended to study other hemoglobinopathies, 
globin family proteins, or mutations underlying genetic disorders.</p>

<p>Conclusion
The bioinformatics analysis of HBB confirms its strong evolutionary conservation across mammals and highlights the 
functional significance of conserved residues, particularly Glu6. The E6V substitution responsible for 
sickle cell disease exemplifies how single, evolutionarily conserved sites are critical for protein stability and function. 
Integrating BLAST similarity searches, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction provides a robust workflow for 
connecting molecular evolution, protein structure, and clinical genetics.

This project demonstrates how computational biology can bridge evolutionary insights with medical relevance, 
providing both academic and translational value.

        <h2>Conceptual Framework for a Low-Cost Coagulation Profile Test Kit for Underserved Health Facilities in Ghana</h2>
        <p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hemostasis, the process that prevents excessive bleeding following vascular injury, 
depends on the balanced function of the 
coagulation cascade, platelets, and fibrinolysis. Laboratory tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT), 
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and fibrinogen assays are critical in diagnosing coagulation disorders, 
monitoring anticoagulant therapy, and guiding clinical interventions in conditions such as liver disease, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), and venom-induced consumption coagulopathy.
In Ghana, however, access to coagulation testing is severely limited. While tertiary hospitals are equipped with 
coagulometers and automated analyzers, district and rural health facilities often lack these diagnostic capabilities, 
leaving a significant proportion of the population without timely access to essential clotting tests. This diagnostic 
gap contributes to delayed treatment, increased morbidity, and avoidable mortality.
To address this challenge, this project proposes the conceptual design and future development of a low-cost, locally 
adaptable coagulation profile test kit. The kit is intended to be stable at room temperature, affordable, easy to use by 
mid-level health workers, and adaptable to low-resource environments.</p>

Objectives
<p>‚¶Å	The specific objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>‚¶Å	To design a coagulation profile test kit capable of simultaneously performing PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen testing.</p>
‚¶Å<p>	To identify cost-effective reagent formulations optimized for stability under tropical conditions (25‚Äì30¬∞C).</p>
<p>‚¶Å	To simplify assay workflows for point-of-care use, minimizing reliance on advanced equipment.</p>
‚¶Å	<p>To establish a framework for clinical validation and quality assurance against reference laboratory standards.</p>
<p>‚¶Å	To ultimately expand access to life-saving diagnostic tools for underserved health facilities in Ghana.</p>

<p>Proposed Methodology</p>

<p>1. Reagent Development
Prothrombin Time (PT):
Development of a thromboplastin reagent (tissue factor + phospholipids) with stabilizers (e.g., glycerol or sugars) to 
ensure heat stability.</p>

<p>Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):
Preparation of kaolin/cephalin reagent mix as intrinsic pathway activators. The formulation will be optimized for 
reproducibility while reducing batch variability.</p>

<p>Fibrinogen (Clauss method adaptation):
Simplified thrombin-based reagent system for fibrinogen quantification. The assay workflow will be adapted to require 
minimal pipetting steps.</p>

<p>2. Kit Assembly</p>

<p>‚¶Å	Packaging reagents into small, single-use vials to reduce waste and contamination.
‚¶Å	Color-coded labeling and simplified procedural steps for ease of use.
‚¶Å	Instructional material (infographics/manuals) designed for health workers with limited lab training.</p>

<p>3. Prototype Testing and Validation (Future Phase)
‚¶Å	Comparative testing of the kit against standard coagulometers in a tertiary hospital setting.
‚¶Å	Validation parameters: accuracy, reproducibility, precision, and linearity across normal and pathological samples.
‚¶Å	Stability assessment over 3‚Äì6 months at room temperature storage (25‚Äì30¬∞C).</p>

<p>4. Implementation Plan
‚¶Å	Pilot deployment in selected district hospitals and health centers in Ghana.
‚¶Å	Training of health workers on kit use and data recording.
‚¶Å	Feedback integration to improve usability and robustness.</p>

<p>Expected Results and Deliverables</p>
<p>Although still conceptual, the anticipated outcomes of this project include:
‚¶Å	A prototype coagulation profile kit that reliably measures PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels.
‚¶Å	Demonstrated reagent stability under tropical storage conditions.
‚¶Å	Proof of diagnostic accuracy comparable to reference laboratory analyzers.
‚¶Å	A scalable, low-cost diagnostic solution adaptable for other low-resource countries.</p>

<p>Potential Impact</p>
<p>The successful development of a low-cost coagulation test kit has broad implications:
‚¶Å	Clinical impact: Early and accurate diagnosis of bleeding and clotting disorders, improved monitoring of anticoagulant 
therapy, and timely management of emergencies such as snakebite-induced coagulopathy, which is prevalent in rural Ghana.
‚¶Å	Public health impact: Expanding diagnostic capabilities beyond urban tertiary hospitals to rural and peri-urban facilities.
‚¶Å	Economic impact: Reducing the financial burden of referring patients to centralized hospitals and lowering 
morbidity-related costs.
‚¶Å	Scientific impact: Showcasing Ghana‚Äôs capacity to develop home-grown biotechnology solutions tailored for local health 
challenges.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This project outlines a conceptual framework for the development of a low-cost coagulation profile test kit tailored to 
underserved health facilities in Ghana. By integrating simplified assay design, affordable reagents, and tropical stability, 
the kit could bridge a critical gap in hemostasis diagnostics.
While further work is required to move from concept to prototype, the project demonstrates how biomedical innovation can be 
localized to meet pressing healthcare needs. With validation and eventual scaling, this diagnostic tool has the potential 
to significantly improve patient outcomes in low-resource settings and contribute to global health equity.</p>
